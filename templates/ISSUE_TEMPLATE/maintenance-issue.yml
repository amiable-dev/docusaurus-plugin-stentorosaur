        ### YAML Frontmatter Reference
        
        The YAML frontmatter (between `---` lines) is **required** and must include:
        
        - **start**: Maintenance start time in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2025-11-15T02:00:00Z`)
        - **end**: Maintenance end time in ISO 8601 format
        - **systems**: Array of affected system names (optional - will use issue labels if omitted)
        
        ### Time Format Examples
        
        ```yaml
        start: 2025-11-15T02:00:00Z          # 2 AM UTC on Nov 15
        start: 2025-12-01T14:30:00-05:00     # 2:30 PM EST on Dec 1
        start: 2025-11-20T22:00:00+00:00     # 10 PM UTC on Nov 20
        ```
        
        ### Status Tracking
        
        The plugin automatically determines status based on timing:
        - **Upcoming**: Start time is in the future
        - **In Progress**: Current time is between start and end
        - **Completed**: End time has passed OR issue is closed
        
        ### Adding Updates
