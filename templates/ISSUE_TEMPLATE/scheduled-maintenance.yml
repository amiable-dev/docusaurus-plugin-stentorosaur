        ### YAML Frontmatter Reference

        The YAML frontmatter (between `---` lines) is **required** and must include:

        - **start**: Maintenance start time (supports human-friendly dates!)
        - **end**: Maintenance end time (supports human-friendly dates!)

        ### Human-Friendly Date Formats

        ```yaml
        # Natural language (recommended)
        start: @tomorrow 2am UTC
        start: tomorrow at 2pm
        start: next Monday 9am

        # Relative times
        start: +2h              # 2 hours from now
        start: in 3 hours
        start: +30m             # 30 minutes from now

        # Traditional ISO 8601 (still works!)
        start: 2025-11-15T02:00:00Z
        start: 2025-12-01T14:30:00-05:00
        ```

        ### Affected Entities

        Use issue **labels** to indicate affected systems/processes:

        - Or use namespaced: `system:api`, `process:onboarding`

        Labels are matched against your configured entities in `docusaurus.config.js`.

        ### Status Tracking

        The plugin automatically determines status based on timing:
        - **Upcoming**: Start time is in the future
        - **In Progress**: Current time is between start and end
        - **Completed**: End time has passed OR issue is closed
