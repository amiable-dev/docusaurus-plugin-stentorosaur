We're excited to announce Stentorosaur v0.17.0, bringing enhanced monitoring capabilities and improved stability to your Docusaurus status pages.

<!--truncate-->

## What's New

### Improved Response Time Tracking

Response time charts now render more efficiently with optimized Chart.js configurations. The historical data visualization handles larger datasets without performance degradation.

### Better Error Handling

The plugin now gracefully handles GitHub API rate limits and network failures. When issues occur, the status page falls back to cached data rather than showing errors.

### Maintenance Window Support

Define planned maintenance windows in `maintenance.json` to prevent false incident creation during scheduled downtime.

```json
{
  "windows": [
    {
      "start": "2026-01-05T02:00:00Z",
      "end": "2026-01-05T04:00:00Z",
      "reason": "Database migration"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install @amiable-dev/docusaurus-plugin-stentorosaur
```

Add to your `docusaurus.config.js`:

```js
plugins: [
  ['@amiable-dev/docusaurus-plugin-stentorosaur', {
    statusPagePath: '/status',
    monitorConfigPath: '.monitorrc.json'
  }]
]
```

## What's Next

We're working on multi-channel notifications (Slack, Discord, Telegram) and enhanced CSV/JSON export capabilities for v0.18.0.
