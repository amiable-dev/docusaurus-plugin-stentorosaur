  - Tests for error handling (invalid JSON, missing directories, readdir failures)
  - Tests for CI environment detection and warnings
  - Tests for incident limiting to 20 most recent
  - Tests for response time calculation with history fallback

### Infrastructure

- Updated `jest.config.js` to enforce 80% coverage thresholds
- All 73 tests passing with strict coverage requirements

## [0.2.1] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed

- `update-status.cjs` now writes to `build/status-data/` in CI environments (#14)
  - Detects CI via `process.env.CI` or `process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS`
  - Creates `build/status-data/` directory automatically in GitHub Actions
  - Resolves issue where status data wasn't committed by `status-update.yml` workflow
  - Fixes production bug where incidents weren't appearing on status page

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-01

### Added

- Response time tracking for monitored systems (#1)
  - Captures response time in milliseconds for each health check
  - Stores response time data in per-system JSON files
  - Displays response time in commit messages (e.g., "ðŸŸ© api is up (200 in 145 ms)")
- Time-window response time averages (#1)
  - 24-hour average response time (`timeDay`)
  - 7-day average response time (`timeWeek`)
  - 30-day average response time (`timeMonth`)
  - Calculated hourly via git history analysis
- Uptime percentage tracking (#1)
  - 24-hour uptime percentage (`uptimeDay`)
  - 7-day uptime percentage (`uptimeWeek`)
  - 30-day uptime percentage (`uptimeMonth`)
  - All-time uptime percentage (`uptime`)
  - Calculated hourly from commit history patterns
- New workflow: `calculate-metrics.yml` for computing time-series metrics
- Per-system JSON files in `build/status-data/systems/` directory
- TypeScript interfaces for system status files with metrics
- Plugin now reads and merges system file data with GitHub issue data
- Comprehensive system data documentation in `templates/status-data/systems/README.md`

### Changed

- `monitor-systems.yml` now captures response time using `curl -w "%{time_total}"`
- System status data now stored in individual JSON files (one per system)
- Plugin prioritizes calculated metrics over GitHub issue fallbacks
- Commit messages include response time (e.g., "ðŸŸ© website is up (200 in 234 ms)")

### Fixed

- `monitor-systems.yml` recovery logic now uses `automated` label instead of `critical` (#12, #13)
  - Prevents auto-closing of manually created status issues
  - `critical` label now purely represents severity, not creation source
  - Auto-created issues tagged with `automated` label for proper filtering
  - Only workflow-generated issues are auto-closed on recovery

- Documented response time and uptime tracking
- Example system JSON file structure
